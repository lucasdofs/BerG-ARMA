# BerG-ARMA
This code is part of my Ph.D. dissertation - Here are presented functions of the BerG- ARMA process:
- Generated_BerG_ARMA_Process -> Generate observations of the process
- fit_bergARMA -> Is the fit of the model, returning parameter estimation, standard errors, log-likelihood value, AIC, BIC, and residuals.
- bergARMA_aplication -> Code with the applications used in the paper.
